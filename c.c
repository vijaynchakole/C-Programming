should goverment accept relief fund from the other country for kerala flood


kerala is one of the most educated state in india. most of the young generation of kerala working abroad with help of their higher education.
so the when other contries like UAE providing funds for kerala relief  its doesn't mean that they are considering our country like poor, they just want to help the families of those people who are working in  their country.

india is becaming the superpower in the world. but now india facing biggest problem that is kerala flood. taking the help from other countries, its like we are unable to overcome on this situation by our self. we  have enough money and man power to overcome on this flood.central  goverment has already announced 500 crore repees help for kerala. but its  not enough, we need a more money and  a food.there is a still heavy rain is going on. our army force already reached there to help suffering people. they  are working hard to put peeple to the safe zone. they are working 24 hours a day. 

Prime minister naredra Modi said that , we are helping  needy people. and in future there is more financial help going to come from central as well as from state goverment. the prime minister requested to the people and  the NGO  to help the  kerala as far as you can either is in money form  and material or food. they are in trouble and its our duty to help them. please god save your own country.

there is no official report that UAE has announced 700 crore aid for kerala relief flood. UAE geverment comes forward and stated that, we are going to help kerala but  still we have not announced any amount and we have created four member team for it and they are collecting  data and necessary information  for next step.  

refusing the  help from other country is the matter of pride. but in my opinion, its the false pride as there is no any hegistation and pride fall while taking help from other countries. in last many dacade, india doing  the same to other countries  those were in trouble.  its a natural disaster and we will soon overcome it.


write a letter as a bank manager,informing a customer about the refusal of his / her loan application in polite manner.

write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper about the rising level of air pollution in the city and  ways that can be adopted
to curb it





Hi sir,

 I am writing a letter to you, regarding high level of air pollution in our city which is very harmful for our health.
 In last month we had celebrate our festival .In that festival we have seen many of the ganesh mandal used high frequency sound system for their enjoyment. but because of it, children and adult people suffered a lot, some of them lost their hearing sense.
another main reason behind air pollution, is excessive or unnecessarly use of horn in residencial and school area. there must be a law for use horn. few people don't have a sense humor for where to use horn. its my humble request please look into the matter and explore it so that goverment must take appropriate action as soon as possible.
