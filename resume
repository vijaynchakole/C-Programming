Hi Team,

I have  done three major projects and one of them is research based project.
1) Virtual file system
2)Data Structures Shared Library Development
3) File wrapper class

1) Virtual file system -:
its a research based project which is used to understand the internal concept of file system .
For this project I have used pure C programming language .
In this project I have refers  Unix file system (UFS).
In this project I try to provide every functionality which is available in existing file system.

**************************************************************************************************
2)Data Structures Shared Library Development -:
Library is considered as a program which contains multiple functions in it which can be used by other program.
If we designed library then while application development we can reused library whenever needed.
There are two types of executable in every operating system
 *self-execuable file
*dependeable executable file
dependeable executable file considered as .dll in Windows and .so in Linux.
In this project, I have provided all LinkedList functionality.
for example,
InsertFirst( ), InsertLast( ), InsertAtPosition( ), DeleteFirst( ), DeleteLast( ), DeleteAtPosition( ), SearchNode( ),DisplayNodes( ), ReverseLL( ) and many more.

 **************************************************************************************************

3) File wrapper class -:
This project is considered as library development project.
 We can use this project into other software development task.
 For this project I have used C++ as a programming language.
 In this wrapper class I have provided all the functionality which requirement  
 for  file handling operation.


currently I am working on project which is use concept of multithreading.
 In this project I am using multithreading concept for searching file from different directoties.

I am passionate programmer.
